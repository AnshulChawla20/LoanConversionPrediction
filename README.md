This project focuses on developing a predictive model for Thera Bank's marketing campaign to improve the conversion rate of liability customers into personal loan customers. By leveraging machine learning techniques like gradient boosting, logistic regression, and ensemble methods, we aim to create an effective prediction model.

Key Features:

Dataset: Thera Bank customer data with demographics, banking history, and customer behavior variables.
Implemented classification algorithms: Gradient Boosting, Logistic Regression, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN), and Naïve Bayes.
Evaluated model performance using accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score metrics.
Identified the best performing model: Gradient Boosting with 99% accuracy in predicting loan conversion.
Explored ensemble methods like Voting Classifier and Bagging Classifier to further enhance prediction accuracy.
Our project provides valuable insights into identifying potential customers who are more likely to accept personal loan offers, enabling Thera Bank to optimize their marketing efforts. With targeted marketing decisions based on this predictive model, Thera Bank can increase their conversion rates and improve business outcomes.

Through this repository, we contribute to the field of marketing analytics and offer a resource for others interested in similar prediction tasks. Join us in exploring the loan conversion prediction domain and leveraging machine learning for effective marketing campaigns.
